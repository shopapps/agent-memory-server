-   🔄 **Memory Integration Patterns**

    ---

    Three patterns for using memory: LLM-driven, code-driven, and background extraction

-   📝 **Working Memory**

    ---

    Session-scoped storage for active conversation state

    [Working Memory →](working-memory.md)

-   🧠 **Long-term Memory**

    ---

    Persistent, cross-session storage for knowledge that should be retained

-   🎯 **Memory Extraction Strategies**

    ---

    Configure how memories are extracted: discrete, summary, preferences, or custom
